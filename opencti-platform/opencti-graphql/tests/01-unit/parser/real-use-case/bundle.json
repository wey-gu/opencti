TETRA, or Terrestrial Trunked Radio, employed to control essential systems like power grids, gas pipelines, and trains, has been found to possess a deliberate backdoor in its encryption algorithm, allowing for relatively easy hacking.\n\nThe team at cybersecurity firm Midnight Blue made this alarming discovery and alerted relevant authorities. Despite efforts to raise awareness, many critical infrastructure entities remain unresponsive to the risks posed by these vulnerabilities.\n\n - Two of the flaws are characterized as critical. The first (CVE-2022-24401) is an oracle decryption attack that can be used to reveal text, voice, or data communication. It is made possible by the Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator's reliance on network time, which is broadcast publicly and without encryption.\n\n - The second (CVE-2022-24402) is an engineering weakness ‚Äì the TEA1 [PDF] encryption algorithm, according to the researchers, \"has a backdoor that reduces the original 80-bit key to a key size which is trivially brute-forceable on consumer hardware in minutes.\"\n\n - Researchers from Midnight Blue identified a backdoor in the encryption algorithm of TETRA radios, which are manufactured by companies such as Motorola, Damm, and Hytera. The intentional vulnerability, easy to exploit, allows attackers to compromise the network and execute malicious commands. These attacks can disrupt critical infrastructure operations and even enable unauthorized access to emergency services, posing a grave threat to public safety.\n\n - TETRA technology is widely used across the world, controlling vital infrastructure in more than 120 countries. For instance, in the Netherlands, the port of Rotterdam, public transport companies, most airports, and the C2000 communication system utilized by the police, fire brigade, ambulance services, and parts of the Ministry of Defence rely on TETRA.\n\n - Additionally, many critical infrastructure authorities in Germany, France, Spain, and various European countries, as well as several equivalent entities in the USA, depend on this radio technology.\n\n - The most concerning aspect of these vulnerabilities is how accessible they are to potential hackers. According to Midnight Blue, even individuals without extensive hacking expertise can infiltrate the TETRA network in under a minute using simple hardware. Once inside, attackers can execute malicious commands on critical infrastructure systems without detection, leading to severe consequences.","first_seen":"2023-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"VULNERABILITY","severity":"HIGH"},{"id":"relationship--cc90e76b-c353-4131-a07d-9abab8a36f82","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"EU","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--de39cac0-31d2-5df6-83fe-6d1f14820b50","target_ref":"location--c8ae98e5-97cf-5913-ba23-bc95ffd9c5af"},{"id":"relationship--76fa5aac-555c-479b-a117-6d79a998cd00","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--de39cac0-31d2-5df6-83fe-6d1f14820b50","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--1f05efe8-018a-4a28-981c-127e50720f7c","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"TRANSPORT","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--de39cac0-31d2-5df6-83fe-6d1f14820b50","target_ref":"identity--4a5a8971-1cd1-5a11-8843-267e17b105ac"},{"id":"relationship--7c2e2be8-e131-4cd7-b284-17e5f1e67121","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"ENERGY","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--de39cac0-31d2-5df6-83fe-6d1f14820b50","target_ref":"identity--166544e2-ba1f-5a6c-89cf-a63d0c01e91c"},{"id":"relationship--f64ed847-99e5-4e33-aca2-89863ff12f64","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--de39cac0-31d2-5df6-83fe-6d1f14820b50"},{"id":"location--ba41277e-8451-5941-ad12-2d71acb043b1","spec_version":"2.1","type":"location","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Country","location_type":"Country"}},"name":"MD"},{"id":"threat-actor--7f47ce54-16c8-5fb1-b905-8006861f4884","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"APT29","threat_actor_types":["DATA"],"primary_motivation":"ESPIONAGE"},{"id":"identity--92743d78-08e6-5426-95c9-504f81b94da9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nInformation regarding European partners","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--89086bf3-75c5-5239-aea5-cfb8881c6c33","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://radiochisinau.md/-un-atac-cibernetic-masiv-asupra-sistemului-guvernamental-de-comunicatii-a-fost-detectat-in-preajma-summitului-comunitatii-politice-europene-de-la-bulboaca-revista-presei---183639.html","url":"https://radiochisinau.md/-un-atac-cibernetic-masiv-asupra-sistemului-guvernamental-de-comunicatii-a-fost-detectat-in-preajma-summitului-comunitatii-politice-europene-de-la-bulboaca-revista-presei---183639.html"}],"name":"Cyber-attack on the government's communications system was detected in the vicinity of the European Political Community summit in Bulboaca","description":"- Reported on July 25, ten days before the European Community summit in Chisinau, the employees of the Information Technology and Cyber ??Security Service reported about the breach of the government communications system.\n\n - The main target would have been the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

A diagnostic phase is in progress, during which the websites were still unavailable.\n\n - Sources suggest that the attack was initiated from a simple email that allowed hackers to break into the computer servers of GrandAngoul√™me. However, no one would have clicked on the link introduced in the e-mail. The servers being connected to those of the city of Angoul√™me, they too were also affected.\n\n - In the meantime, the urban community specifies that all the services and facilities of GrandAngoul√™me remain physically open at the usual times, such as the Nautilis aquatic complex, for example. The Alpha media library remains open but only on-site consultation is possible. The town planning services remain open to the public, but the examination of files is suspended. GrandAngoul√™me Habitat physically receives users but cannot respond to requests by telephone.\n\n - For the city of Angoul√™me, all services remain open, but only physically.

The flaw arises from improper handling of the 'vzeroupper' instruction during speculative execution, a technique used in modern processors for performance enhancement.\n\n- By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious actor could steal sensitive data, like passwords and encryption keys, from each CPU core at a rate of 30KB/sec. The flaw impacts all AMD CPUs built on the Zen 2 architecture, including Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 4000U/H, Ryzen 5000U, Ryzen 7020, ThreadRipper 3000, and Epyc server processors.\n\n- Ormandy reported the issue to AMD, which has released microcode updates to address the problem. Users are advised to apply the updates promptly, but an alternate mitigation method is available by setting the \"chicken bit\" to DE_CFG[9], though it may cause a CPU performance drop. While the practical impact on regular users is relatively low due to requiring local access and specialized knowledge, it is essential to keep systems updated with the latest security patches and BIOS upgrades to prevent exploitation.","first_seen":"2023-07-23T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"VULNERABILITY","severity":"HIGH"},{"id":"relationship--e634e88b-a76f-434e-86d7-1348ffd9fb03","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n( Users of AMD Zen2 CPUs, including Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 4000U/H, Ryzen 5000U, Ryzen 7020, ThreadRipper 3000, and Epyc server processors)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--9c75cb58-effc-5675-8b99-02502ee3df08","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--fab3a105-c2bd-4055-a6dd-d9e530cc80d0","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n( Users of AMD Zen2 CPUs, including Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 4000U/H, Ryzen 5000U, Ryzen 7020, ThreadRipper 3000, and Epyc server processors)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--9c75cb58-effc-5675-8b99-02502ee3df08","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--fdc3a75c-d746-472c-817f-5db289b7879b","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n( Users of AMD Zen2 CPUs, including Ryzen 3000, Ryzen 4000U/H, Ryzen 5000U, Ryzen 7020, ThreadRipper 3000, and Epyc server processors)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--9c75cb58-effc-5675-8b99-02502ee3df08"},{"id":"identity--715ff5ce-8351-545e-b46f-38ffbb524958","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Unknown\n(Users of Apple Devices Running Vulnerable Software Versions)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--948927fd-3925-55d1-a03e-bc6b5414f06b","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/apple/apple-fixes-new-zero-day-used-in-attacks-against-iphones-macs/","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/apple/apple-fixes-new-zero-day-used-in-attacks-against-iphones-macs/"}],"name":"Apple Releases Security Updates to Address Zero-Day Exploits","description":"- On July 24, Apple has released security updates to address zero-day vulnerabilities that have been exploited in attacks targeting iPhones, Macs, and iPads.

Users of OpenSSH are strongly advised to update to the latest version to protect against potential cyber threats.","first_seen":"2023-07-23T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"VULNERABILITY","severity":"HIGH"},{"id":"relationship--b775c389-0cb7-4ab1-83cd-afa6bbc3b699","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Organizations using OpenSSH before version 9.3p2)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--79c7ae62-71d6-55e2-b3ee-66b422845287","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--da9d96e3-a17b-4220-9848-17a239471a58","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Organizations using OpenSSH before version 9.3p2)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--79c7ae62-71d6-55e2-b3ee-66b422845287","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--8475019f-2fce-4a82-84b7-f1e951af4081","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Organizations using OpenSSH before version 9.3p2)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--79c7ae62-71d6-55e2-b3ee-66b422845287"},{"id":"threat-actor--9c8a44fb-94a5-5440-9067-c3799b3ab188","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"North Korean State-Sponsored Lazarus Hacking Group","threat_actor_types":["MALWARE"],"primary_motivation":"UNKNOWN"},{"id":"identity--99701985-ed31-525a-a3f1-6e7148f6e427","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Unknown\n(Users and Visitors of Compromised Websites and Services Hosted on Breached IIS Servers)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--72dbeebc-48bb-56c6-a20b-89541bb32694","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/55369/","url":"https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/55369/"},{"source_name":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-hijack-microsoft-iis-servers-to-spread-malware/","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-hijack-microsoft-iis-servers-to-spread-malware/"}],"name":"Lazarus Hackers Target Windows IIS Servers for Malware Distribution","description":"- Reported on July 24, the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, Lazarus, is targeting Windows Internet Information Service (IIS) web servers to distribute malware.\n\n- Lazarus leverages poorly protected IIS services for malware distribution, taking advantage of the ease of infecting visitors and users of websites and services hosted on breached IIS servers. In recent attacks observed in South Korea, Lazarus compromised legitimate websites to carry out 'Watering Hole' attacks on visitors using a vulnerable version of the INISAFE CrossWeb EX V6 software, commonly used for electronic financial transactions and internet banking.\n\n- The group exploits known vulnerabilities in INISAFE to deliver malware payloads from compromised IIS web servers. Lazarus uses 'JuicyPotato' privilege escalation malware to gain higher-level access to the compromised system and execute additional malware loaders for AV evasion.\n\n- To mitigate the risk, ASEC recommends updating to the latest version of INISAFE CrossWeb EX V6. Microsoft application servers, including IIS and Exchange, are increasingly targeted by hackers for malware distribution, highlighting the need for robust security measures and regular updates to prevent such attacks.","first_seen":"2023-07-23T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"INCIDENT","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--a7fb5d65-59a0-4965-b644-416d06c57a23","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users

at ASEC. This kernel module rootkit has the ability to conceal itself, other malicious codes, files, directories, and network traffic.\n\n- What sets Reptile apart is its reverse shell, allowing easy system control, and its use of Port Knocking to connect to a Command and Control (C&C) server. Reptile aids in malware installation and equips attackers with Listener, a command-line tool for executing commands on infected systems.\n\n- The rootkit's reverse shell connects to the C&C server using the Port Knocking technique, making it harder to detect. Reptile shares similarities with other backdoor malware, suggesting it may be influenced by existing rootkits and backdoors. European users should be cautious and implement strong security measures to protect against this new threat.","first_seen":"2023-07-23T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"NEW TTPS","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--b8c90e8e-8e7e-4778-8a96-ead1524e09cb","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Linux-based systems, particularly those exposed to Reptile's attack vectors)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--b5d13d06-9201-5928-80ab-87019fdce38d","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--ed858277-8e7c-41b5-83f2-21440c66ffac","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Linux-based systems, particularly those exposed to Reptile's attack vectors)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--b5d13d06-9201-5928-80ab-87019fdce38d","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--a0b5b91a-1fb2-4774-b9bb-e89bf6dcb868","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"Unknown\n(Reptile Rootkit)","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Linux-based systems, particularly those exposed to Reptile's attack vectors)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--4c03e439-9aad-559d-b745-2c4e6f6f7ff7","target_ref":"identity--b5d13d06-9201-5928-80ab-87019fdce38d"},{"id":"location--b67bc0e2-28e9-5993-9841-0aa7d2f9c3af","spec_version":"2.1","type":"location","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Country","location_type":"Country"}},"name":"ID"},{"id":"identity--89262c5b-e83e-5025-be03-2e8ff5b91b57","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"BCA Bank and its Credit Card Users","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--35b0d036-e9c6-50ca-aeb9-967f29302940","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://twitter.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1683431233374547968","url":"https://twitter.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1683431233374547968"}],"name":"Data Breach Exposes BCA Bank Credit Card Users' Information","description":"- On July 24, a user on a hackers forum is advertising the sale of a database containing the personal information of BCA Bank credit card users.

SiegedSec's motives appear to be a blend of hacktivism and personal gain, with the attack serving as retaliation against perceived human rights infringements by NATO.\n\n- Cybersecurity research firm Cyberint has been monitoring SiegedSec's activities, describing them as a specialized \"special forces unit\" within the hacktivist landscape.

400,000 corporate credentials stolen by info-stealing malware","description":"- Reported on July 25, the analysis of nearly 20 million information-stealing malware logs sold on the dark web and Telegram channels revealed that they had achieved significant infiltration into business environments.\n\n - Information stealers are malware that steals data stored in applications such as web browsers, email clients, instant messengers, cryptocurrency wallets, FTP clients, and gaming services. The stolen information is packaged into archives called 'logs,' which are then uploaded back to the threat actor for use in attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces.\n\n - The most prominent information-stealing families are Redline, Raccoon, Titan, Aurora, and Vidar, offered to cyber criminals on a subscription-based model, allowing them to conduct malware campaigns that steal data from infected devices.\n\n - While information stealers primarily target careless internet users who download software, such as cracks, warez, game cheats, and fake software from dubious sources, it has also been found to have a massive impact on corporate environments.\n\n - This is because employees use personal devices for work or access personal stuff from work computers, resulting in many info-stealer infections stealing business credentials and authentication cookies.\n\n - More specifically, as cybersecurity firm Flare explains in a new report shared with BleepingComputer, there are approximately 375,000 logs containing access to business applications such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Quickbooks, AWS, GCP, Okta, and DocuSign.\n\nMore specifically, Flare found the following in the examined stealer logs:\n\n    179,000 AWS Console credentials\n    2,300 Google Cloud credentials\n    64,500 DocuSign credentials\n    15,500 QuickBooks credentials\n    23,000 Salesforce credentials\n    66,000 CRM credentials\n\n - In addition to the above, there are about 48,000 logs that include access to \"okta.com,\" an enterprise-grade identity management service used by organizations for cloud and on-premise user authentication.\n\n - Most of these logs (74%) were posted on Telegram channels, while 25% were seen on Russian-speaking marketplaces, like the 'Russian Market.'","first_seen":"2023-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"RESEARCH","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--108e13ed-712d-4cb1-a84c-b7ec01acdcc9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Salesforce\nHubspot\nQuickbooks\nAWS\nGCP\nOkta\nDocuSign","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--e5913c0a-30a1-5212-883d-bc8749838022","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--e38a252a-7064-4ad7-8613-4399931cbf43","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Salesforce\nHubspot\nQuickbooks\nAWS\nGCP\nOkta\nDocuSign","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"ALL","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--e5913c0a-30a1-5212-883d-bc8749838022","target_ref":"identity--77b6c36d-3572-5e26-899b-5c9a406d1764"},{"id":"relationship--ed62b67f-355b-4e4b-9e27-9a3c37bbb219","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"Redline\nRaccoon\nTitan\nAurora\nVidar","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Salesforce\nHubspot\nQuickbooks\nAWS\nGCP\nOkta\nDocuSign","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--2809fd21-12dc-5c32-aa11-c09b95431cc2","target_ref":"identity--e5913c0a-30a1-5212-883d-bc8749838022"},{"id":"identity--035840f7-5980-5144-9d7d-ca161b3d3dc3","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Sector"}},"name":"DIGITAL SERVICE PROVIDER","identity_class":"class"},{"id":"threat-actor--b5fe635a-fcbc-5c8e-b517-d81f76d691c9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"Realst","threat_actor_types":["MALWARE"],"primary_motivation":"FINANCIAL GAIN"},{"id":"identity--5b3bb93c-173f-5158-92ad-f487fea0d43d","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Apple macOS systems\nmacOS 14 Sonoma","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--1cb289c9-79f8-5f36-8cb7-02de9763f2ac","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/rust-based-realst-infostealer-targeting.html","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/rust-based-realst-infostealer-targeting.html"},{"source_name":"https://iamdeadlyz.gitbook.io/malware-research/july-2023/fake-blockchain-games-deliver-redline-stealer-and-realst-stealer-a-new-macos-infostealer-malware","url":"https://iamdeadlyz.gitbook.io/malware-research/july-2023/fake-blockchain-games-deliver-redline-stealer-and-realst-stealer-a-new-macos-infostealer-malware"}],"name":"Rust-based Realst Infostealer Targeting Apple macOS Users' Cryptocurrency Wallets","description":"- Reported on July 26, a new malware family called Realst has become the latest to target Apple macOS systems, with a third of the samples already designed to infect macOS 14 Sonoma, the upcoming major release of the operating system.\n\n - Written in the Rust programming language, the malware is distributed in the form of bogus blockchain games and is capable of \"emptying crypto wallets and stealing stored password and browser data\" from both Windows and macOS machines. Realst was first discovered in the wild by security researcher iamdeadlyz.\n\n - Realst Infostealer is distributed via malicious websites advertising fake blockchain games with names such as Brawl Earth, WildWorld, Dawnland, Destruction, Evolion, Pearl, Olymp of Reptiles, and SaintLegend. Each version of the fake blockchain game is hosted on its own website complete with associated Twitter and Discord accounts.\n\n - 16 variants across 59 samples were identified, with the activity likely having links to another information stealer campaign called Pureland, which came to light earlier this March. Windows machines, on the other hand, are infected with RedLine Stealer.\n\n - The attack chains begin with threat actors approaching potential victims through direct messages on social media, convincing them to test a game as part of a paid collaboration, only to drain their cryptocurrency wallets and steal sensitive information upon execution.\n\n - The web browsers targeted for harvesting include Brave, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Vivaldi. Apple Safari is a notable exception. The malware is also capable of gathering information from Telegram and capturing screenshots.\n\n - The developments come as data captured via commercial information stealers are being packaged and sold for profit on dark web marketplaces and Telegram channels, with over 200,000 OpenAI credentials leaked via stealer logs in 2022 and 2023, according to multiple reports from Bitdefender and Flare.\n\n - Stolen enterprise credentials, in particular, can act as a channel for initial access brokers to breach organizations, which can then be auctioned off to other actors looking to exploit the foothold for follow-on activities such as ransomware deployment.","first_seen":"2023-07-25T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"NEW TTPS","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--274ff325-b356-4878-9951-0026042977ec","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Apple macOS systems\nmacOS 14 Sonoma","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--5b3bb93c-173f-5158-92ad-f487fea0d43d","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--d0247684-5a0e-4429-b900-3643b1b3f701","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Apple macOS systems\nmacOS 14 Sonoma","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--5b3bb93c-173f-5158-92ad-f487fea0d43d","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--a528d02e-5335-44f9-9e24-7873083d653b","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Apple macOS systems\nmacOS 14 Sonoma","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL SERVICE PROVIDER","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--5b3bb93c-173f-5158-92ad-f487fea0d43d","target_ref":"identity--035840f7-5980-5144-9d7d-ca161b3d3dc3"},{"id":"relationship--ed8afcc7-d123-4bd0-b779-a9cbbe9b20ab","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"Realst","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Apple macOS systems\nmacOS 14 Sonoma","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--b5fe635a-fcbc-5c8e-b517-d81f76d691c9","target_ref":"identity--5b3bb93c-173f-5158-92ad-f487fea0d43d"},{"id":"threat-actor--5b261d96-69a3-5b52-8baf-a5a82234b60c","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"SparkRAT","threat_actor_types":["TROJAN"],"primary_motivation":"FINANCIAL GAIN"},{"id":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Unknown","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--0c030c45-1375-56e1-8a8d-901d937b3ef7","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://cybersecuritynews.com/hackers-mimic-popular-vpn/","url":"https://cybersecuritynews.com/hackers-mimic-popular-vpn/"}],"name":"Hackers Mimic Popular VPN Download page to Deliver Malware","description":"- Reported on July 26, threat actors have been using domestic VPN installation files for distributing SparkRAT malware which leads to MeshAgent infection on the victim systems.

Specifically, a ‚Äúread-only‚Äù reentrancy is one that does not update the state of a contract.\n\n - According to the report, the attacker drained funds in two separate transactions using the externally owned account. The attacker relied on a vulnerability in ‚Äúthe callback and _updateReserves function‚Äù to manipulate a contract into reporting old values that had not yet been updated.\n\n - Era Lend is a fork of the Syncswap project, and CertiK claimed that other projects based on Syncswap may also be vulnerable to the exploit.\n\n - Era Lend team had also acknowledged the attack and paused the protocol‚Äôs zkSync contracts to prevent further exploits.\n\n  - These vulnerabilities are difficult for auditors to spot, since typically, auditors and bug hunters are only concerned with entry points that modify state when looking for reentrancy. To help alleviate this problem, it has been recommended that auditors should use specialized software to aid them in finding these vulnerabilities.\n\n - EraLend is designed to maximize the capital efficiency while minimizing the risks associated with the dependency on external liquidity & oracles.

The emails include the same PDF attachment used to compromise the previous victim hosts, and so the chain is executed once more.\n\n - What's changed in recent spam waves is that the attack is kick-started by a spear-phishing email embedded with a link to an HTML file that redirects the target to download a RAR file, a deviation from the use of malicious PDF attachments with a download link to a ZIP file.","first_seen":"2023-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"NEW TTPS","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--48ba2da2-ce2e-4844-9093-edf6fb0be277","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Latin American financial institutions","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--3118f728-e7d0-5a6c-b4d4-b0772f3b47e0","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--f99d3101-792c-4a9c-a78b-44073cc30f4c","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Latin American financial institutions","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--3118f728-e7d0-5a6c-b4d4-b0772f3b47e0","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--ec158ffa-d852-45a7-9dbd-ca4862044c2e","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Latin American financial institutions","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"BANKING/FINANCE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--3118f728-e7d0-5a6c-b4d4-b0772f3b47e0","target_ref":"identity--03b13ebd-fa1b-5d46-943b-91e866142db5"},{"id":"relationship--5ca96a6b-1112-4e99-b27b-40b109c3a24c","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"Casbaneiro","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Latin American financial institutions","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--f6ec8b7c-1d16-58a9-a654-960e2557adc6","target_ref":"identity--3118f728-e7d0-5a6c-b4d4-b0772f3b47e0"},{"id":"identity--ad392c36-8c2b-5b38-bf53-5a0c38ed46c1","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--4db3e5ed-d9d4-50ac-8625-4e9b00e07051","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://www.hackread.com/microsoft-message-queuing-service-flaw-dos-attacks/","url":"https://www.hackread.com/microsoft-message-queuing-service-flaw-dos-attacks/"},{"source_name":"https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/microsoft-message-queuing-service-vulnerabilities","url":"https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/microsoft-message-queuing-service-vulnerabilities"}],"name":"Critical Flaws Exposed Microsoft Message Queuing Service to DoS Attacks","description":"- Reported on July 25, researchers at the AI-powered Security solutions provider, FortiGuard Labs, have been monitoring Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) service for the past few months.

Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect.\n\n - This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default \"admin\" user, with its password being an empty string until October 2021, at which point administrators were prompted to update the blank passwords with the release of RouterOS 6.49.\n\n  -

It is unclear who is behind the malware but researchers at DNS-focused security vendor Infoblox believe that four actors are wielding and developing it for highly-targeted operations.\n\n - Observed activity is limited to the Russian and Eastern Europe space and appears to be related to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.\n\n -  DecoyDog likely has the ability to download malware payloads on infected devices and execute commands sent by the attackers.\n\n - At the time, the researchers said that they ‚Äúfound the identical DNS query patterns arising from enterprise networks, which could not be tied to consumer devices‚Äù and ‚Äúconfirmed that the queries originated from network appliances in a very limited number of customer networks.‚Äù\n\n - Whoever operates the toolkit did not cease activity after Infoblox announced their discovery and published a technical analysis showing that Decoy Dog was heavily based on the Pupy open-source post-exploitation remote access trojan (RAT).\n\n - New Infoblox research revealed that ‚ÄúDecoy Dog is a major upgrade from Pupy that uses commands and configurations that are not in the public repo.‚Äù\n\n - Some of the differences observed include:\n\n    Decoy Dog uses Python 3.8 while Pupy was written in Python 2.7. Decoy Dog requires Python 3.8\n    numerous improvements including Windows compatibility and better memory operations\n    Decoy Dog significantly expands the communications vocabulary in Pupy by adding multiple communications modules\n    Decoy Dog responds to replays of previous DNS queries where Pupy does not.\n    unlike Pupy, Decoy Dog responds to wildcard DNS requests, which doubles the number of resolutions seen in passive DNS.\n    Decoy Dog responds to DNS requests that don‚Äôt match the structure of valid communication with a client.\n    Decoy Dog adds the ability to run arbitrary Java code by injecting it into a JVM thread and adds methods to maintain persistence on a victim device.\n\n - Based on passive DNS traffic analysis, it is difficult to determine an accurate number of Data Dog clients, which would indicate impacted devices, but the largest number of active concurrent connections that Infoblox observed on any one controller was less than 50 and the smallest was four.\n\n - It is estimateed that the current number of compromised devices would be less than a few hundred, indicating a very small set of targets, typical of an intelligence operation.\n\n - Some of the changes one Decoy Dog operator made after Infoblox‚Äôs disclosure was to add a geofencing mechanism that limits responses from controller domains to DNS queries from IP addresses in specific regions. Although this may imply that the victims are in Russia, the actor could also have chosen to route victim traffic through the region as a decoy or to limit the queries to relevant ones.\n\n - Infoblox distinguishes between the four actors operating Decoy Dog based on the observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, it appears that they all respond to queries that match the right format for Decoy Dog or Pupy. If the theory of multiple actors handling Decoy Dog is true, there may be two development groups that improved the toolkit with new functionality.\n\n - At the moment, Decoy Dog operations remain a mystery as far as their purpose and handlers go. Infoblox has done its part in uncovering the toolkit using DNS data from its systems and bringing it to the attention of the infosec community. However, additional research is required to determine the targets, the initial compromise method (e.g. supply chain, known vulnerability, zero-day in targeted devices), and how actors move into the network","first_seen":"2023-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"NEW TTPS","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--095b793c-42c6-4294-a8ba-fdecdb14ace4","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--b7183bdd-e16e-4a2d-97f1-b138c45c187d","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"PUBLIC ADMIN","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_ref":"identity--3041c4b0-deba-5347-826c-4727e2103133"},{"id":"relationship--270e1d9e-4048-44c4-a211-92911ccef3af","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"TARGETED INDIVIDUAL","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_ref":"identity--2a936d6d-dec1-5a5c-80fc-b44f797aa250"},{"id":"relationship--9ce14e88-ddb8-4fec-91fd-1d73f0828d01","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"Decoy Dog","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--8314f4e6-e7eb-5137-86ff-c11758817bf5","target_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3"},{"id":"identity--919a5443-bd39-517e-b820-63edf263b8d9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Sector"}},"name":"UNKNOWN","identity_class":"class"},{"id":"threat-actor--18819df4-b7b0-599c-afb0-ae638db02cf6","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"NoBit","threat_actor_types":["RANSOMWARE"],"primary_motivation":"FINANCIAL GAIN"},{"id":"incident--46c5eae3-1af2-5637-8a37-2227954cbf5c","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://thecyberexpress.com/nobit-raas-new-generation-ransomware-builder/","url":"https://thecyberexpress.com/nobit-raas-new-generation-ransomware-builder/"},{"source_name":"https://twitter.com/Cyberknow20/status/1683839884480622599","url":"https://twitter.com/Cyberknow20/status/1683839884480622599"}],"name":"NoBit RAAS, a New Generation Ransomware Builder Marketed on Dark Web","description":"- Reported on July 26, a new and powerful ransomware as a service (RAAS) has emerged and is marketing its prowess on the dark web.\n\n - Dubbed as NoBit RAAS builder, the malicious software is being promoted by an elusive threat actor and is being called the ‚Äúhottest product‚Äù on the dark web.\n\n - The threat actor responsible for promoting NoBit RAAS builder is not holding back on its claims of destructive capabilities. The ransomware builder‚Äôs straightforward interface enables even novice hackers to easily create potent ransomware strains.\n\n - One of the aspects of NoBit RAAS builder is its ability to encrypt virtually any file, leaving no data safe from its grasp. This includes sensitive information tucked away in directories like the recycle bin and AppData, where users often store personal and important files.\n\n - This includes sensitive information tucked away in directories like the recycle bin and AppData, where users often store personal and important files.\n\n - According to the threat actor‚Äôs post, the NoBit RAAS builder offers a range of powerful features that make it the weapon of choice for malicious actors.\n\n - For $200, users gain access to a lifetime license for the builder, allowing them to create unlimited ransomware strains. If they wish to explore the source code and delve into the program‚Äôs inner workings, it comes at a higher price tag of $1000.\n\n - The builder comes equipped with a range of essential blocks that users can manipulate to customize their ransomware.\n\n - Among these are a key block, an AES-128 key, and a wallpaper editor, allowing users to craft a unique and ominous message for their victims.\n\n - Additionally, there‚Äôs a ransom note block where users can draft and upload their demands in .rtf file format, specifying the ransom amount and the contact email for negotiating the payment.\n\n - A separate miscellaneous section allows users to omit language restrictions, ensuring that the ransom demand reaches a wide audience.\n\n - Once the NoBit RAAS attack has been successfully executed on a victim‚Äôs computer, a threat message is displayed on the desktop, leaving them with very few options.\n\n - The message explicitly states that all their files have been encrypted using an advanced encryption system, and the only way to regain access to their precious data is by paying the hefty ransom of $5000.\n\n - The threat actors are cunning enough to warn victims against changing file types, editing the content, or decrypting the files without the provided key, as it could lead to irreversible data loss.\n\n - The contact email, NoBit@yourcomputer, serves as the point of contact between the victims and the malicious actors. Once the payment is made, victims are instructed to click the ‚ÄúDecrypt‚Ä¶‚Äù button to initiate the decryption process using the provided key.\n\n - NoBit RAAS builder is a dangerous and sophisticated ransomware as a service that highlights the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals. Since NoBit RAAS builder is active on the dark web marketplaces, threat actors might want to invest in this service to create ransomware strains, which can later be used to target unsuspecting victims. Apart from RAAS builders, leaked code also come handy for cybercriminals.","first_seen":"2023-07-25T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"NEW TTPS","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--c50c34f4-9f02-4e51-86c1-ce250d069bd8","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--e4e01564-a827-4e35-8ae7-57eb5f9ebd1f","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"UNKNOWN","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_ref":"identity--919a5443-bd39-517e-b820-63edf263b8d9"},{"id":"relationship--b395f36e-5fb2-45d8-98e4-4cb60d5b754d","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"NoBit","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--18819df4-b7b0-599c-afb0-ae638db02cf6","target_ref":"identity--cbb95bee-d85f-5a95-b9e3-dd3b2ba550e3"},{"id":"threat-actor--bb862f34-a8de-55c0-92dc-5b71da8652e0","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"Spyhide stalkerware","threat_actor_types":["SPYWARE"],"primary_motivation":"ESPIONAGE"},{"id":"identity--405f77a5-15ef-5e2d-83d3-b6de48a72ac1","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Android phones","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--d738d923-4eb3-5740-beae-0850bbcbabf6","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/spyhide-stalkerware-android/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9tc2d1aWRlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIcvTJ5OJsAKt_HfL7JfiZdmz8Cuof_ENoWYP-p_TwjKNdXzNcLYVxDByUQr21PM_oSSuR0L3EuNQsZ_AepFo422z_Xil0tkseAJIYeU9xG4PY4b9i7RAt804_fFMll_kj_t0LiqCPL1QtvpRSTNKCx0H9Puhm9RiDsLFpgqKZs_\nhttps://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-android-stalkerware-app-has-infected-60000-devices-is-it-on-your-phone","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/spyhide-stalkerware-android/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9tc2d1aWRlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIcvTJ5OJsAKt_HfL7JfiZdmz8Cuof_ENoWYP-p_TwjKNdXzNcLYVxDByUQr21PM_oSSuR0L3EuNQsZ_AepFo422z_Xil0tkseAJIYeU9xG4PY4b9i7RAt804_fFMll_kj_t0LiqCPL1QtvpRSTNKCx0H9Puhm9RiDsLFpgqKZs_\nhttps://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-android-stalkerware-app-has-infected-60000-devices-is-it-on-your-phone"},{"source_name":"https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/fuckstalkerware-2/","url":"https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/fuckstalkerware-2/"}],"name":"Android stalkerware app has infected 60,000 devices","description":"- Reported on July 26, tens of thousands of the best Android phones are infected with a stalkerware app that secretly collects private data from them.\n\n - As reported, the Spyhide stalkerware has been installed on 60,000 Android phones since 2016. Unlike malicious apps which send stolen data to hackers, Spyhide and other stalkerware apps steal sensitive data and send it back to spouses or other people looking to keep tabs on victims.\n\n - What makes stalkerware apps so dangerous is their ability to stay hidden on a compromised phone which makes them difficult to detect and uninstall. Once loaded onto an Android smartphone, Spyhide silently collects and uploads a victim‚Äôs contacts, messages, photos, call logs, recordings of their calls and even their location in real-time.\n\n - While Spyhide has been quietly collecting data on victims for years now, a Switzerland-based hacker has managed to gain access to part of the stalkerware‚Äôs development environment which has shed new light on this stalkerware.\n\n - The hacker was able to gain access to Spyhide‚Äôs back-end database by exploiting a vulnerability in the stalkerware‚Äôs dashboard and has detailed their findings in a new blog post.\n\n - The stalkerware‚Äôs database contains detailed records of 60,000 compromised Android devices including call logs, text messages and years of location history. Alongside this sensitive data, there‚Äôs also information about each file like when a photo or video was taken and uploaded by Spyhide.\n\n - According to TechCrunch‚Äôs analysis, Spyhide‚Äôs operations are worldwide. While there are only 3,100 compromised devices in the U.S., American victims are the most surveilled based on the fact that there are more than 100,000 location data points in the country alone.\n\n - At the same time, the stalkerware‚Äôs database also contains records on 750,000 users that signed up to gain access to Spyhide, likely with the intention of installing the stalkerware on someone else‚Äôs smartphone.\n\n - Additionally, the database includes 3.29 million text messages, 2FA codes, password reset links, over 1.2 million call logs, 312,00 call recording files, 925,000+ contact lists and records for 382,000 photos and images.

This malicious campaign, orchestrated by cybercriminals, aims to steal victims' email login credentials for illicit purposes.\n\n- The modus operandi of the attack involves sending an email that appears legitimate, notifying recipients of a supposed bank payment in their favor. To \"view\" the payment receipt, users are invited to click on a link provided in the email body. Once the user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a fake webpage that appears to belong to a legitimate bank or payment service. On this page, two images are displayed: a fake invoice and a fake bank transfer receipt, both skillfully created to appear authentic.\n\n- However, to download these documents, the victim is asked to provide their email login credentials, including the email address and associated password. This is where the malicious actors attempt to exploit people's good faith for malicious purposes.\n\n- If successful, the cybercriminals steal the victim's credentials, granting them unauthorized access to the email account. Once this access is obtained, the user's personal, financial, and sensitive data become prey to the scammers. The consequences can be severe and include identity theft, reputation damage, and potential financial harm.\n\n- The \"Bank Payment Notice\" phishing campaign is just one example of scams aimed at taking advantage of users' inexperience. Awareness, attention, and caution are the best defenses against these malicious operations.","first_seen":"2023-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"CAMPAIGN","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--3444406b-8d16-4098-8675-205ea549e669","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Unsuspecting Email Users)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"IT","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--71d69f44-6e15-5975-9407-9a426ea865eb","target_ref":"location--4d6e8db8-2368-53e5-b82c-8796027160ff"},{"id":"relationship--589a0a46-404d-4074-a52e-d7c6a6487be1","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n(Unsuspecting Email Users)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"TARGETED INDIVIDUAL","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--71d69f44-6e15-5975-9407-9a426ea865eb","target_ref":"identity--2a936d6d-dec1-5a5c-80fc-b44f797aa250"},{"id":"relationship--5cc7ed54-99bb-432f-a9eb-cffd6d116b1f","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n(Unsuspecting Email Users)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--71d69f44-6e15-5975-9407-9a426ea865eb"},{"id":"identity--31800043-4cef-5e39-9b81-aeea73079a9a","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"The portal of the Lithuanian media project -

GraphicalProton: Advanced Phishing Attack on Eastern European Diplomatic Entities","description":"- On July 28, the Russian nation-state actor, BlueBravo (also known as APT29, Cloaked Ursa, and Midnight Blizzard), has been targeting diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe with a new backdoor called GraphicalProton.\n\n- The phishing campaign, observed between March and May 2023, utilizes legitimate internet services (LIS) for command-and-control obfuscation, making detection more challenging. GraphicalProton is the latest addition to BlueBravo's arsenal of malware, and it uses Microsoft's OneDrive or Dropbox for communication, unlike its predecessor GraphicalNeutrino, which used Notion for C2. BlueBravo seems to prioritize cyber espionage against European government sector entities, possibly linked to the Russian government's interest in strategic data during and after the war in Ukraine.\n\n- The malware is delivered through ISO or ZIP files attached to phishing emails, disguised as vehicle-themed lures, and targeted towards diplomatic organizations. Network defenders are urged to be vigilant about the misuse of legitimate services within their enterprises to prevent such attacks.","first_seen":"2023-07-27T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"CAMPAIGN","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--a03dd1c6-697c-4b08-862d-1e710c02c6de","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Diplomatic Organizations in Eastern Europe","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"EU","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--68490a35-d7da-5ea4-abde-80016239a2a2","target_ref":"location--c8ae98e5-97cf-5913-ba23-bc95ffd9c5af"},{"id":"relationship--f561fc76-3a22-4b3e-a66e-19f9acc4c0e9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Diplomatic Organizations in Eastern Europe","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"PUBLIC ADMIN","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--68490a35-d7da-5ea4-abde-80016239a2a2","target_ref":"identity--3041c4b0-deba-5347-826c-4727e2103133"},{"id":"relationship--d449a111-2f7f-41f8-865b-6253335012aa","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"BlueBravo","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Diplomatic Organizations in Eastern Europe","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--f81ff9f6-fc76-503b-b28a-832e2c8d6639","target_ref":"identity--68490a35-d7da-5ea4-abde-80016239a2a2"},{"id":"identity--43d82cf2-46df-5df5-8165-5947b904535e","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"NATO (COI Portal)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--fe9b355e-8bfd-5a58-8ee3-02b57a376fbd","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nato-investigates-alleged-data-theft-by-siegedsec-hackers/","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nato-investigates-alleged-data-theft-by-siegedsec-hackers/"}],"name":"Massive Data Breach Hits NATO's COI Portal: 845MB of Stolen Files and 8,000 Rows of Sensitive User Data Exposed","description":"- Reported on July 26, NATO's IT team was investigating an alleged data theft hack on the Communities of Interest (COI) Cooperation Portal by a hacking group called SiegedSec.\n\n- The COI Cooperation Portal is an unclassified information-sharing platform used to support NATO organizations and member nations. The hacking group posted on Telegram, claiming to have stolen hundreds of documents from the portal, compromising 845MB of files, 8,000 rows of sensitive user-related information, unclassified documents, and user account access details.\n\n- The leaked data includes full names, company/unit details, job titles, business email IDs, residence addresses, and photos, affecting 31 NATO member nations. While SiegedSec doesn't seem financially motivated, they appear to be hacktivists targeting NATO in protest against member countries' attacks on human rights.

The criminal group operated through a sophisticated call center, using persuasion techniques to convince victims to invest small amounts initially, promising high returns through fake trading platforms.\n\n- Over 90,000 telephone contacts of Italian citizens were identified, and around 42,000 phone calls made by the call center were intercepted. The investigation revealed an estimated financial scam exceeding five million euros, with potentially much larger sums involved. The group's sophisticated technical skills allowed them to obfuscate their true IP addresses, making it difficult to trace their actions.\n\n- Additionally, victims' money was converted into cryptocurrencies linked to untraceable foreign accounts.

high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2023-21406) in its A1001 network door controller, which could expose facilities to physical and cyber threats.\n\n- The flaw, related to the Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP), allows a heap-based buffer overflow in the controller's pacsiod process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability, discovered by industrial cybersecurity firm Otorio during an access control assessment project, can be exploited by attackers with physical access to the RS-485 twisted pair cable at the back of the access control reader.\n\n- This could enable unauthorized access to secured facilities, tampering with logs, and even remote code execution, posing a potential gateway to the internal IP network. Axis has released patches and security enhancements to address the issue, and Otorio plans to release an open-source OSDP assessment tool in the future.","first_seen":"2023-07-26T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"VULNERABILITY","severity":"HIGH"},{"id":"relationship--5aa62d7d-17d4-447a-903e-8c02df44a4ab","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Axis A1001 Network Door Controller and facilities relying on its security features)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"SE","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--20c6c8e8-f881-5aea-9b1a-75e0138f2ab5","target_ref":"location--8c1f964e-4084-56d4-ae6d-4375e4f56fe0"},{"id":"relationship--6086ca56-77cc-4a24-85fd-5ba46e111df7","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Axis A1001 Network Door Controller and facilities relying on its security features)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--20c6c8e8-f881-5aea-9b1a-75e0138f2ab5","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--4f894b9a-bae2-48ca-8a50-d2f06d253864","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Axis A1001 Network Door Controller and facilities relying on its security features)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL SERVICE PROVIDER","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--20c6c8e8-f881-5aea-9b1a-75e0138f2ab5","target_ref":"identity--035840f7-5980-5144-9d7d-ca161b3d3dc3"},{"id":"relationship--3f9a6753-61bf-44c7-8d7c-80af2c56daeb","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n(Users of Axis A1001 Network Door Controller and facilities relying on its security features)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--20c6c8e8-f881-5aea-9b1a-75e0138f2ab5"},{"id":"threat-actor--1ced1878-9686-5377-9911-7ab5875a7e6b","spec_version":"2.1","type":"threat-actor","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Threat-Actor-Group"}},"name":"Unknown\n(Hacker group with an \"overseas government background\")","threat_actor_types":["INTRUSION"],"primary_motivation":"ESPIONAGE"},{"id":"identity--68704746-fa64-56e4-8eb2-9bf450c388d0","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center (China)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--2abb8bd0-2b29-5fb5-8413-be5fa6d6d8d8","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/china-wuhan-earthquake-cyber-attack/","url":"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/china-wuhan-earthquake-cyber-attack/"}],"name":"Cyber-Attack on Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center Linked to Overseas Government","description":"- The Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center in China fell victim to a cyber-incident perpetrated by a hacker group with an \"overseas government background,\" according to the Chinese Communist Party-owned Global Times newspaper's report on July 26.\n\n- The Wuhan Municipal Emergency Management Bureau confirmed the cyber-attack and stated that affected equipment was immediately sealed off and authorities were informed.\n\n- The newspaper claimed that preliminary evidence pointed to the US as the source of the government-backed cyber-attack.

The attackers utilized a web shell script named \"neww\" to gain access to the Tomcat web application manager through a brute force attack using different credential combinations. Once successful, the threat actors deployed a malicious WAR file containing the web shell class 'cmd.jsp', allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised Tomcat server, including downloading and running the \"neww\" script.\n\n- The final stage malware is a variant of the notorious Mirai botnet, which utilizes the infected hosts for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. To defend against this campaign, organizations are advised to secure their environments and practice good credential hygiene to thwart brute-force attacks. Additionally, the report highlights the rise of cryptocurrency mining, with a 399% increase in cryptojacking attacks globally in the first half of 2023, indicating the lucrative nature of such cyber activities.","first_seen":"2023-07-26T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"INCIDENT","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--fdc06b49-d0d7-4c4c-8491-c3e004675c75","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--d28fcd38-3b50-5922-95f7-4114fb6053cf","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--79988433-6ac5-411c-8875-62b0a6d80f72","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--d28fcd38-3b50-5922-95f7-4114fb6053cf","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--0d181fff-b2d0-4017-8bb0-61885aa4f161","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Misconfigured and poorly secured Apache Tomcat servers","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--d28fcd38-3b50-5922-95f7-4114fb6053cf"},{"id":"identity--917532dc-61cc-5102-8863-3bae7da3c6d7","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Unknown\n(Users and organizations relying on ModSecurity WAF for web application protection)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--a2073546-d401-5107-8a66-c763de2e7915","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://cybersecuritynews.com/modsecurity-waf-flaw-let-hackers-trigger-dos-attack/","url":"https://cybersecuritynews.com/modsecurity-waf-flaw-let-hackers-trigger-dos-attack/"}],"name":"DoS Vulnerability in ModSecurity Web Application Firewall","description":"- Reported on July 27, Trustwave's open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) engine, ModSecurity, has been found to have a Denial of Service (DoS) risk due to a vulnerability in four transformation actions.\n\n- The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-38285, was identified by Trustwave's cybersecurity researchers who alerted the ModSecurity team.

The agencies recommend adopting secure-by-design principles and ensuring proper authentication and authorization checks for all requests that modify, delete, or access sensitive data.\n\n- The advisory comes in the wake of CISA's analysis of risk and vulnerability assessments, revealing that \"Valid Accounts\" were the most common successful attack technique used by threat actors. To counter this, critical infrastructure entities are urged to implement strong password policies and employ phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication while monitoring access and network communication logs for abnormal activities.\n\n- In addition the advisory highlights critical vulnerabilities that could impact users and businesses worldwide, including those in Europe. European organizations and individuals who use web applications could be at risk of falling victim to data breaches and unauthorized access due to IDOR flaws.","first_seen":"2023-07-27T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"WARNING","severity":"HIGH"},{"id":"relationship--38443ca0-e025-4fe2-b867-50075a91fd92","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Consumers of Web Applications)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"GLOBAL","target_type":"Country"}},"relationship_type":"located-at","source_ref":"identity--8a53ea2b-0b38-518b-a0a6-e2af5b02816a","target_ref":"location--de567b9e-23e2-5ac0-af7f-e18af656c98f"},{"id":"relationship--f943ff27-4445-44b7-ad79-5a8a499d933e","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sro","type":"part-of","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Consumers of Web Applications)","source_type":"Organization","target_value":"DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE","target_type":"Sector"}},"relationship_type":"part-of","source_ref":"identity--8a53ea2b-0b38-518b-a0a6-e2af5b02816a","target_ref":"identity--07de313a-9056-58a2-b824-8442025ecb28"},{"id":"relationship--7e38abeb-c8be-4bc2-bb99-783196bb03e9","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"targets","source_value":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","source_type":"Threat-Actor-Group","target_value":"Unknown\n(Users and Consumers of Web Applications)","target_type":"Organization"}},"relationship_type":"targets","source_ref":"threat-actor--e984d89c-48e8-5c5e-8201-95517aff63bd","target_ref":"identity--8a53ea2b-0b38-518b-a0a6-e2af5b02816a"},{"id":"identity--666a08f8-12fe-5375-a612-780f5bec3156","spec_version":"2.1","type":"identity","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"Organization"}},"name":"Unknown\n(Users of Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) email servers)","identity_class":"organization"},{"id":"incident--d3929d82-dab7-5948-a62e-bbe2f4ba9682","spec_version":"2.1","type":"incident","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"new-sdo","type":"Incident"}},"external_references":[{"source_name":"https://securityaffairs.com/148880/security/zimbra-fixed-2023-38750-zcs.html","url":"https://securityaffairs.com/148880/security/zimbra-fixed-2023-38750-zcs.html"}],"name":"Active Attacks Target Zimbra Email Servers with Zero-Day XSS Vulnerability","description":"- On July 27, Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) email servers were targeted in active attacks exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2023-38750, reflecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n- Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered the flaw, which allowed unauthorized access to internal JSP and XML files.

The attackers employ various PowerShell file variants, continuously updating files to evade security product detection. They also use file servers lacking authentication, increasing the risk of further exploitation.\n\n- To protect against this threat, users are advised to exercise caution with untrusted links, avoid engaging with suspicious URLs and files, and keep their systems and antivirus tools up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.","first_seen":"2023-07-27T22:00:00.000Z","incident_type":"VULNERABILITY","severity":"MEDIUM"},{"id":"relationship--7a5072bd-0ed7-4c10-8a41-a2048035a70a","spec_version":"2.1","type":"relationship","extensions":{"extension-definition--ea279b3e-5c71-4632-ac08-831c66a786ba":{"extension_type":"property-extension","type":"located-at","source_value":"Unknown\n(Users
